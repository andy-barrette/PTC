This software package is for measuring psycho-acoustic tuning curves (PTCs). Measuring your PTC is a tedious process. The resulting PTC represents beed-over between filters in your ear as a function of the heard sound. These filters pick out separate frequencies, but their ability to do so degrades as you age.

The zipped Matlab version actually works. The standalone version written in C++ is unfinished.
